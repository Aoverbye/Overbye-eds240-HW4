# Questions & Answers

**1. Which option do you plan to pursue?**

I still plan on doing the infographic

**2. Restate your question(s). Has this changed at all since HW #1? If
yes, how so?**

My question is still where is freight coming from and going and when is
that happening. As I have been learning about this, I have realized
there has been a freight recession that is ending now, while I think I
will still keep my question general, I could see myself taking some of
my data and specifying it more towards that.

**3. Explain which variables from your data set(s) you will use to
answer your question(s), and how.**

The main variable is the freight variable from the freight_all data set,
this is how many freight in pounds is sent with each trip. Additionally,
I am using destination and origin information for my graphs.

**4. Find at least two data visualizations that you could (potentially)
borrow / adapt pieces from. Link to them or download and embed them into
your .qmd file, and explain which elements you might borrow (e.g. the
graphic form, legend design, layout, etc.)**

[inspo1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlakeRMills/TidyTuesday/main/2022/Alternative%20Fuel%20(1%20March%202022)/AlternativeFuel.png)

I liked this graph because it shows a readable map.

[inspo2](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c38b44c-b525-4f45-9888-5efb4ff64ba0_2550x1694.png)

I like this one because it shows how to incorperate line charts and a
bart chart into a graph, as that is what I am now planning on doing.

**5. Hand-draw your anticipated visualizations, then take a photo of
your drawing(s) and embed it in your rendered .qmd file – note that
these are not exploratory visualizations, but rather your plan for your
final visualizations that you will eventually polish and submit with**

![Airplanes!](mockup.png)

**6 Mock up all of your hand drawn visualizations using code.**

See below

**7. Answer the following questions:**

a.  *What challenges did you encounter or anticipate encountering as you
    continue to build / iterate on your visualizations in R? If you
    struggled with mocking up any of your three visualizations (from #6,
    above), describe those challenges here.*

There I am trying to figure out a way to make it all work together in
one graph, then add things like typefaces and figure out text size, this
is something I have yet to accomplish. Also, choosing what variables and
making a map of the airports and how they connect. I originally choose
the routes that were traveled the most, but then realized that I was
using pounds in the timeline to connect it all, so I should probably use
pounds elsewhere as well.

a.  *What ggplot extension tools / packages do you need to use to build
    your visualizations? Are there any that we haven’t covered in class
    that you’ll be learning how to use for your visualizations?*
    -   Airportr and geosphere are the two off the top of my head. We
        have used so many different packages in different classes, it is
        hard to remember. There is also a failed Saike chart down there,
        and I think there are some packages I used for that, but it was
        very frustrating, so I don't really remember the packages, just
        the frustration.
b.  *What feedback do you need from the instructional team and / or your
    peers to ensure that your intended message is clear?*

Please ignore the typos, I know there are a lot. I think just knowing
what I should put where and the size of things. I know this document is
much messier than the previous one. I am a little scared to organize it
incase I throw something off with the data processing. I think
aesthetics, as far as size goes. I have not messed around with the
smaller aesthetics as much as I would have liked to. I really want to
know what questions y'all have about this subject and what parts of it
do you think are the most interesting the pull out? What questions do
these plots bring to mind?

### Definition of Freight

"Freight is generally understood to be merchandise or commodities that
are moved by a mode of transportation, such as a truck, ship, aircraft,
pipeline, or train. Freight transportation is the physical process of
transporting commodities or merchandise from one place to another for a
fee."
[source](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/23cpr/chap11.cfm#:~:text=Freight%20transportation%20is%20the%20physical,to%20another%20for%20a%20fee.)

```

```{r}
freight_all <- freight_all %>% select(-distance_group)
```

# Data editing for the map

## Create DF with Freight_all and airport coordinates

### Sorting out the iatas

I have been planning to use the airportr package to be able to get the
coordinates for each airport for the map I want to make. I realized
after looking at the freight data that there were world codes but no
variable for the iata. After examining the data, I learned the iatas
were just the 'origin' and 'dest' columns.

```{r}
# Rename origin and dest columns
freight_all <- freight_all %>% 
  rename(iata_origin = origin) %>% 
  rename(iata_dest = dest)
```

I will also need to create columns in the air_coords data that will have
the same names as the columns in the freight_all dataframe

```{r}
# Duplicating iata coloumn
air_coords$iata_origin = air_coords$iata

# Renaming original iata column
air_coords_rn <- air_coords %>% 
  rename(iata_dest = iata)
```

### Adding coordinates to both the destination airports and the origin airports

Up until now, most of my work on dataframes with coordinates only had
one set of coordinates per row, but in this case I will need there to be
two. To start this process, I need to take the air_coords data and
duplicate the lat-longs so that there is one for the destination, and
one for the origin. I am a bit concerned here because I do not know if
it matters if the lat longs are not called latitude/longitude

```{r}
# Duplicate and rename lat longs
air_coords_rn$lat_dest = air_coords_rn$latitude
air_coords_rn$long_dest = air_coords_rn$longitude
```

Then I will rename the original lat longs

```{r}
# Rename original lat longs
air_duocoords <- air_coords_rn %>% 
  rename(lat_origin = latitude) %>% 
  rename(long_origin = longitude)
```

### Joining the data

The first time I did this, it was with a full join which resulted in a
lot of NAs, but then I used the left join and just joined the twice to
ensure that the data had the coords matched for both dest and orign. To
double check they were correct, I went through and manually checked a
couple flights to see if they were correct and they were!

```{r}
# Join freight_all with air_duocoords to get destination coordinates
freight_coords <- freight_all %>%
  left_join(air_duocoords %>%
              select(iata_dest, lat_dest, long_dest), 
            by = "iata_dest") %>%
  # Join again to get origin coordinates
  left_join(air_duocoords %>%
              select(iata_origin, lat_origin, long_origin), 
            by = "iata_origin")
```

# Begin Plot Process

# Plot map graph

### Getting data for the most common routes

Before I can plot a map, I wanted to make sure I could limit the number
of routes to the ones with the most trips. Otherwise the map would just
be a bunch of lines with no helpful information

```{r}
# airport_routes <- freight_coords %>%
#   group_by(iata_origin, iata_dest) %>%
#   mutate(route_count = n()) %>%  # Create a new column with the count of routes
#   ungroup() %>%  # Remove grouping after adding the count
#   distinct(iata_origin, iata_dest, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%  # Keep only unique routes
#   arrange(desc(route_count))  
```

```{r}
airport_routes <- freight_coords %>%
  group_by(iata_origin, iata_dest) %>%
  mutate(freight_shipped = sum(freight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%  # Sum freight shipped for each route
  ungroup() %>%  # Remove grouping after adding the freight count
  distinct(iata_origin, iata_dest, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%  # Keep only unique routes
  arrange(desc(freight_shipped)) 
```

#### Get only the top 20 routes

```{r}
# Filtering for the top 20 routes
top_20_routes <- airport_routes %>%
  arrange(desc(freight_shipped)) %>%
  head(20)
```

```{r}
top_10_routes <- airport_routes %>%
  arrange(desc(freight_shipped)) %>%
  head(10)
```

  # Get intermediate points between origin and destination
  inter <- gcIntermediate(c(dep_lon, dep_lat), c(arr_lon, arr_lat), n=50, addStartEnd=TRUE, breakAtDateLine=FALSE)
  inter <- data.frame(inter)
  
  # Check if the route crosses the date line (180 degrees longitude)
  diff_of_lon = abs(dep_lon) + abs(arr_lon)
  
  # Plot lines accordingly based on whether it crosses the date line or not
  if(diff_of_lon > 180){
    # Split the line into two parts and plot each separately
    lines(subset(inter, lon >= 0), ...)
    lines(subset(inter, lon < 0), ...)
  } else {
    # Plot the whole line as a single segment
    lines(inter, ...)
  }
}
```

##### Note about how the coords work

left: The x-coordinate for the left edge of the inset (closer to 0 moves
it left). right: The x-coordinate for the right edge of the inset
(closer to 1 moves it right). top: The y-coordinate for the top edge of
the inset (closer to 1 moves it upward). bottom: The y-coordinate for
the bottom edge of the inset (closer to 0 moves it downward).
